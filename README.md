# nlw4_node_api
Node API project created throughout the Rocketseat's NLW#04

Obs: There are some code snippets in this project that are simply for training and debug purposes.
Like returning the created entities. Explicit declarations of already default values, as for example
specifying the status code as 200. Obvious comments. Optional approaches commented out. Etc.
